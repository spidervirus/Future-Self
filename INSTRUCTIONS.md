# Project: Future Self

## 1. Core Value Proposition

The core value of "Future Self" is to provide users with a unique blend of mental/emotional support and motivation, fostering a deep emotional connection with an AI-powered version of their ideal future self.

The application aims to serve users in three primary ways:
*   **Mental/Emotional Support:** An AI companion to talk to, acting as a supportive friend or therapist.
*   **Motivational Guidance:** An AI mentor that guides users towards achieving their personal goals.
*   **Integrated Support:** A combination of both motivational guidance and emotional support, tailored to the user's needs.

The ultimate goal is to help users:
*   Set and achieve goals aligned with their ideal future self.
*   Receive consistent mental and emotional support.
*   Reflect on their progress through daily or weekly AI-driven feedback.
*   Stay motivated through scheduled feedback and push notifications.

## 2. MVP Features

    *   "What country or culture feels most like 'home' to you?" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: Help the AI mirror cultural tone and references
    *   "Where in the world are you right now?" (Drop-down City/Country)
        - Purpose: Help with time-zone or geo-specific guidance (weather, events)

**B. Tell Me More About You:**
*   **Current State:**
    *   "What's been on your mind lately?" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: Help AI reflect recurring emotions or mental loops
    *   "Where do you feel most like yourself?" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: Help AI ground the user by revealing their feel-most-authentic self

        - Purpose: Give AI emotional material for positive feedback
    *   "What's one thing you wish someone would just remind you when you're feeling down?" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: Create a tailored "pick me up" phrase for moments of overwhelm

**C. Moving from A to B:**
*   **Growth Focus:**
    *   "What's one thing you keep saying you'll change... but haven't yet?" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: Reveals stuck behavior patterns AI can gently challenge
    *   "What feeling do you want to experience more this year?" (Comment field)

        - Purpose: Help AI imagine future routine and detect gaps between today vs. tomorrow
    *   "One day, you want to wake up and think: 'I actually did it.'" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: Help AI push toward long-term ambition the user might avoid facing directly
    *   "Upload a photo if you'd like to imagine your Future Self" (Pic upload)
        - Purpose: AI uses it to visually imagine and personalize your future self

**E. Communication Style Preferences:**
*   **Interaction Setup:**
    *   "What are some words or vibes you always trust?" (Comment field)
        - Purpose: AI mirrors user's voice using repeated patterns or phrases
    *   "Do you prefer long messages, or short and straight to the point?" (Drop-down)
        - Purpose: Help shape length and structure of AI replies
    *   "How often do you like to be messaged? (daily / weekly / only when needed)" (Drop-down)
        - Purpose: Sets the AI's communication rhythm
