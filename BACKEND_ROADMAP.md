# Backend Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Future Self backend, covering database design, AI model integration, API development, and deployment.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1. Technology Stack Selection
- **Task:** Set up the backend technology stack.
- **Details:** The stack is confirmed as Python with FastAPI for the backend framework, Supabase (PostgreSQL) for the database, and Ollama for serving the Mistral LLM.
- **Status:** To Do

### 1.2. Database Schema Design
- **Task:** Design and implement the database schema in Supabase.
- **Details:** Create tables in Supabase (PostgreSQL) for users, onboarding responses, conversations, journal entries, goals, and other core entities.
- **Status:** To Do

### 1.3. User Authentication
- **Task:** Implement user authentication using Supabase Auth.
- **Details:** Utilize Supabase's built-in authentication system for user registration, login, and session management.
- **Status:** To Do

### 1.4. Onboarding API
- **Task:** Develop API endpoints for the onboarding process.
- **Details:** Create endpoints in FastAPI to receive and store user onboarding data in the Supabase database.
- **Status:** To Do

## Phase 2: AI & Core Logic (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1. LLM Integration
- **Task:** Integrate with Mistral via Ollama.
- **Details:** Set up API connections from the FastAPI backend to the local Ollama instance serving the Mistral model for generating chat responses.
- **Status:** To Do

### 2.2. AI Personality Engine
- **Task:** Develop the engine for the 5 AI personality modes.
- **Details:** Create logic to dynamically adjust the AI's communication style based on user preferences and conversation context.
- **Status:** To Do

### 2.3. Real-Time Chat
- **Task:** Implement WebSocket-based real-time chat.
- **Details:** Set up a WebSocket server to handle real-time messaging between the user and the AI.
- **Status:** To Do

### 2.4. Voice Message Processing
- **Task:** Develop a service for processing voice messages.
- **Details:** Integrate a speech-to-text API to transcribe user voice messages and a text-to-speech API to generate AI voice responses.
- **Status:** To Do

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Data (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1. Image Generation
- **Task:** Integrate an image generation model (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney).
- **Details:** Create an endpoint for the vision board feature to generate images based on user prompts.
- **Status:** To Do

### 3.2. External Data Integration
- **Task:** Integrate with external APIs for additional data.
- **Details:** Set up services to fetch data from weather, astrology/numerology, and event APIs.
- **Status:** To Do

### 3.3. Background Jobs & Scheduler
- **Task:** Implement a system for background jobs.
- **Details:** Use a task queue (e.g., Celery, Bull) to handle asynchronous tasks like sending daily messages and push notifications.
- **Status:** To Do

### 3.4. Journaling & Affirmations API
- **Task:** Develop API endpoints for the journaling and affirmations features.
- **Details:** Create CRUD endpoints for managing journal entries and affirmations.
- **Status:** To Do

## Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling (Weeks 7-8)

### 4.1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Task:** Define the cloud infrastructure using code.
- **Details:** Use Terraform or CloudFormation to automate the provisioning of servers, databases, and other cloud resources.
- **Status:** To Do

### 4.2. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Task:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- **Details:** Automate the testing and deployment process using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Status:** To Do

### 4.3. Logging & Monitoring
- **Task:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring.
- **Details:** Use services like Datadog, Sentry, or the ELK stack to monitor application performance and track errors.
- **Status:** To Do

### 4.4. Security & Scalability
- **Task:** Conduct security audits and load testing.
- **Details:** Perform penetration testing and ensure the application can handle a large number of concurrent users.
- **Status:** To Do
